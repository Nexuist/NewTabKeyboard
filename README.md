### Introduction

NewTabKeyboard was an iOS jailbreak tweak I released on 6/1/2014. It offered a very tiny improvement to the Safari and Google Chrome browsers by automatically bringing up the keyboard when creating a new tab.

[GitHub Release](soon) TODO

### Next Steps

###### Bugs

* Jeff mentioned in his iDownloadBlog video that the keyboard doesn't open in the default startup tab - oops
* Check if keyboard opens if you open a blank tab in the tab view

As of August 2016, this functionality is still not present in iOS. Updating this tweak for iOS 10 when a jailbreak releases wouldn't be very difficult.

Also, one of the viewers mentioned having a tweak that could open the keyboard in the Messages app whenever you enter a conversation. That could be an interesting path to evolve this tweak - have it open the keyboard in many more apps than just the browser.
