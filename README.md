### Introduction

NewTabKeyboard was an iOS jailbreak tweak I released on 6/1/2014. It offered a very tiny improvement to the Safari and Google Chrome browsers by automatically bringing up the keyboard when creating a new tab.

[GitHub Release](soon) TODO

### Next Steps

###### Bugs

* Jeff mentioned in his iDownloadBlog video that the keyboard doesn't open in the default startup tab - oops

* Does the keyboard open if you open a blank tab in the tab view?

* Does it still work on iOS 10 Safari? Google Chrome?

As of August 2016, the functionality this software provides is still not present in iOS. Updating this tweak for iOS 10 when a jailbreak releases wouldn't be very difficult.

Also, one of the viewers mentioned having a tweak that could open the keyboard in the Messages app whenever you enter a conversation. That could be an interesting path to evolve this tweak - have it open the keyboard in many more apps than just the browser.
